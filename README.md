## Amount of coffee Ingredients
The program should calculate how much water, coffee, 
and milk are necessary to make the specified amount 
of coffee. One cup of coffee made on this coffee machine 
contains 200 ml of _water_, 50 ml of _milk_, and 15 g of 
_coffee beans_.

## Enough coffee for everyone

A real coffee machine never has an infinite supply of water, 
milk, or coffee beans. And if you input a really big number, 
it's almost certain that a real coffee machine wouldn't have 
the supplies needed to make all that coffee.

In this stage, you need to improve the previous program. Now 
you need to input amounts of water, milk, and coffee beans 
that your coffee machine has at the moment.

If the coffee machine has enough supplies to make the specified 
amount of coffee, the program should print "Yes, I can make that 
amount of coffee". If the coffee machine can make more than that, 
the program should output "Yes, I can make that amount of coffee 
(and even N more than that)", where N is the number of additional 
cups of coffee that the coffee machine can make. If the amount 
of resources is not enough to make the specified amount of coffee, 
the program should output "No, I can make only N cup(s) of coffee".

Like in the previous stage, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of 
water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffee beans to make one cup 
of coffee.
